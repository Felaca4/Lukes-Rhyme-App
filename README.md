Lukes-Rhyme-App
===============

http://lukesrhymeapp.appspot.com/

This is just a simple app I made to become familiar with the basics of the Google App Engine and to experiment with various Python functions such as regular expressions.

The app uses the Carnegie Mellon Pronouncing Dictionary which can be found at ftp://ftp.cs.cmu.edu/project/fgdata/dict/cmudict.0.6

I don't care at all what anyone does with this if anything.
